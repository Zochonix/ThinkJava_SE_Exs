Hello there!

__Key Stuff__ :

<details>
  <summary>Contents of the Repository</summary>
  <p></p>
  <p>Ok, this repository contains a bunch of folders and files that represent solutions for the problems which are proposed in the 2nd edition of the "Think Java" book by Allen B. Downey and Chris Mayfield.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Existence of the Rep Explained</summary>
  <p></p>
  <p>I made this repository because I thought it was a neat little project to work on and it has helped me get familiar with the basics of GitHub.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Repository Restrictions</summary>
  <p></p>
  <p>As far as I'm concerned, you are ok to do whatever you want with the code you find in this repository. I'm not too fussed about it.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Future Updates</summary>
  <p></p>
  <p>Right now, I still have to finish off code for many of the chapters and check it before sending it to the repository so this project is still in progress and will be continuously updated, I'll probably have to update this read me though if I make the rep public. :laughing:</p>
