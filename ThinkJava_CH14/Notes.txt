1. Ex14.1 makes use of the SmartPlayer class. The current build uses the solution from 14.3, meaning that the ArrayList contains only standard Player objects.

2. Ex14.2 requires you to change the value of the i variable in the Eights constructor. (Beware that there will be a lot of text on your screen if you set it to iterate 100 times.)

3. Ex14.3 won't work as it's supposed to if you don't set the number of player objects in the ArrayList to at least 2. (Will add error checking at some point.)

4. I have not done a solution to 14.4.
