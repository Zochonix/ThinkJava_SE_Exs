Exercise 3.1 - Solution

If you try to display an int value with %f, you will get an
IllegalFormatConversionException. If you try to display a
double using %d you will get an IllegalFormatConversionException
because d != java.lang.Double, %d is used to display integers.

If you try to use two format specifiers but only
provide a single value, the program will read the
first format specifier only.
