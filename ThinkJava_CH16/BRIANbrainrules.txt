Rules:

State: 0 = on, 1 = dead, 2 = dying

- Cells become alive if they have two neighbors
- Cells that were alive go into dying state if less than two alive neighbours
- Dying state isn't counted as on state
- Dying cells prevent new cells being born in same space
- Dying cells go into the off state
